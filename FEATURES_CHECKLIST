This file contains a list of planned and completed features. If you think a
certain feature would be cool to have, you can add it in the form:
"TODO - <description>"
On the other side of things, when someone finished a feature, we can mark it
by replacing "TODO" with "DONE". If you implement a feature that's not on this
list, you can just add it with the "DONE" prefix.

TODO - configuration file support for mpgc-server
TODO - configuration file support for mpgc-client
TODO - when a client uploads a file that's already in the datadir, don't reupload
TODO - mpgc-server serves a webpage as a client
TODO - mpgc-server receives hash for files, to ensure data-consistency. Can be done using dup.
