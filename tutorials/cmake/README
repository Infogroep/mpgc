This tutorial for the CMake cross-platform build system is based on the
tutorial on their website:
http://www.cmake.org/cmake/help/cmake_tutorial.html

The tutorial starts with a very basic example, and builds upon that. In this
folder, every time cmake features are added, it is stored in a new folder:
version_xx, where xx is a number. This way it is easier to see what actually
changed by experimentation.

The more practical way to use these examples is probably to create a folder,
'build' for example, and run cmake in that directory. This way it is easier to
remove the cmake generated files when you're done experimenting, and the other
directories don't get cluttered with cmake files:
$ mkdir build; cd build; cmake ../version_xx; make
