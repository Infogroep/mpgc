This folder contains examples using libmicrohttpd. Users new to this project
can use these to learn by example before jumping in the actual mpgc code.

A tutorial can be found at:
http://www.gnu.org/s/libmicrohttpd/tutorial.html
This is also the tutorial where most of these examples came from (at the time
of writing).
